    <h3>December 17, 2021 - <em></em></h3>
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, more than ever, a career as a Pilates instructor is in high demand. Think about it, how many times have you thought about the importance of your health and wellness over the last year? Maybe you are also thinking about starting a new career as a Pilates instructor or are a fitness professional interested in adding Pilates instructor to your resume. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the fitness and Pilates industry in ways we couldn't have imagined just a few years ago. Demand for Pilates classes and Pilates instructors has sky-rocketed. Even as brick and mortar Pilates studios are starting to open for in-person classes, access to the internet with Zoom, YouTube and various Social Media platforms has caused home fitness programs to become a very popular option. As a Pilates instructor, you can choose to teach at a local Pilates studio, teach online classes from home or open your own Pilates training studio to support your local community.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Which Pilates Instructor Career Path is Best for Me?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The great thing about becoming a Pilates instructor is that you can choose different career paths to fit your personality and the needs of your participants. Does teaching Mat Pilates Courses interest you? Maybe Pilates Reformer Teacher Certification is what you are looking for? Are you looking to further your Pilates Education by pursuing Advanced Pilates Teacher Certification? Defining your career path ahead of time will bring success and lead you to a rewarding career as a Pilates instructor. After you become a Pilates teacher, you can also offer flexible training options for your students. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At Pilates Instructor Academy, we truly care about your career success. We have over 70 years of collective experience in the fitness and Pilates industry. We know what it takes to build a rewarding Pilates instructor career and will pass the keys of success on to you. The need for more Pilates instructors is out there and our online Pilates certifications will fully prepare you to step into a successful career teaching Pilates. A plan for a career path will guide you as you seek out Pilates certification programs and we are here for guidance and support.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">1. Love Being Social? Work as an Instructor at a Local Pilates Studio</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Do you love connecting with people and making friends in the workplace? Do you like the idea of enhancing the lives of others face-to face while earning an income? Pilates studios are beginning to open up for live classes again. As great as online Pilates classes are, there will always be a market for live, in-person Pilates classes. People choose to take classes at a local Pilates studio for a variety of reasons. Some people prefer the energy of a live, in-person Pilates class. Others join a Pilates studio because it helps keeps them accountable and consistent. You know how it is. Sometimes you just don't feel like working out; but committing to a structured Pilates class with workout buddies helps you stay on track with your fitness goals. Teaching Pilates classes in a studio allows you to connect with others and help your students leave revitalized after a great workout. Studio owners look for Pilates instructors who have completed a comprehensive Pilates teacher training program.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">2. Ready to Work from Home? Teach Your Own Online Pilates Class!</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Quarantines have forced us to consider online Pilates training now more than ever. Our online Pilates teacher training classes are the same content we present in our live workshops, but presented in a convenient streaming format that is accessible, affordable and inclusive. So, if you like the idea of working from home, you can complete Pilates teacher training and start building your client base online. This means your students can comfortably workout when they are at home with their kids, on vacation, or feel that their home is the only safe place for them to practice Pilates. Online Pilates classes are flexible for busy schedules, are in high demand, and offer great opportunities for those with Pilates instructor certifications. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">3. Want to be involved in Your Community? Open Your Own Pilates Studio!</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">No one knows your community better than you, and who better than you to teach Pilates classes in your community? Open a Pilates studio in your local community and introduce the benefits of the mindful strength and flexibility training you can only find in a Pilates class. Does your local community currently have an inclusive Pilates Studio where everyone feels welcome? With your Pilates training certification, you can design classes to meet the needs of everyone in your community. Design classes customized to your local community, and you can make a huge difference in their lives. For example, Pilates classes are perfect for older people, and you could bring beneficial exercise classes to a retirement community. Pilates is also very helpful for pregnant women and for those who have recently had a baby. Your Pilates certification will equip you to adapt Pilates instruction to the demographics of your unique community. Take your passion and make a positive impact on the lives of those in your community by opening your own Pilates studio in your home!</span></p>
